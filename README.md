# KNN-implementation

A matlab implementation for the K-nearest neighbor algorithm. This implementation was part of our coursework.

You can simply run the program by importing the dataset given in **circular.txt** and passing it to the **KNN_crossvalidation** function. Using the following statements.

```
KNN_crossvalidation(importdata(path_to_circular.txt))
```
The **exercise sheet** is given for your ease to understand what we were required to accomplish and how. This is the implementation for the first two questions of the exercise.

I've also uploaded the topic slides, if anyone is interested in understanding the topic.
